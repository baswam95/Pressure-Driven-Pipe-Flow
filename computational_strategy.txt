study case : Hagen-Poiseuille Flow


Physical modeling-based scenario:
initial condition:  constant pressure gradient (inside pipe)
                    <<<<<<<<<<------------
                        wall: u=0, v=0

boundary condition:
-> a rectangular domain (treat this as a slice from a pipe with
   circular cross-sectional alongside the axisymmetrical axis)

-> the left and right edge are connected by periodicity,
   represent an infinitely long domain in x-axis (axisymmetrical axis)

-> top and bottom edge represent fixed wall

-> a constant pressure gradient (in x direction) acts on the entire domain
   (except at boundary extremes: left, right, top, and bottom)

expected output: 
The attained Hagen-Poisseuille profile is indeed independent
of the initial profile and just depends on the strength of
the pressure gradient. After certain amount of time, the 
parabola-based velocity profile will be generated

Computational strategy:
It is not necessarily crucial to compute the velocity profile in y
direction, since it will be approximately to zero throughout the computational domain.

The main interest is on the computation of axisymmetrical flow (in the u-momentum direction).
The u-momentum equation is given as follows:
$    ∂u/∂t + u ∂u/∂x + v ∂u/∂y = - ∂p/∂x + ν ∇²u
                |     |             |       |
                |     ↓             ↓       |
                |    = 0        constant    |
                |                           |
                ↓                           ↓ $
        central differences         five-point stencil

0. Instantiate the u-solution field with ones except for
   the top and bottom boundary

1. Compute convection by periodic central difference
    u ∂u/∂x ≈ u[i, j] ⋅ (u[i+1, (j)] − u[i-1, (j)]) / (2 dx)

2. Compute diffusion by periodic five-point stencil
    ν ∇²u ≈ ν (
        + u[i, (j+1)]
        + u[(i+1), j]
        + u[i, (j−1)]
        + u[(i−1), j]
        − 4 ⋅ u[i, j]
        ) / (dx²)

3. Advance to next step by explicit Euler step
    u ← u + dt ⋅ (− ∂p/∂x + ν ∇²u − u ∂u/∂x)

4. Enforce the wall boundary condition by setting the u velocity
   at the top and bottom boundary to zero

5. Repeat from (1.) until a steady state is reached.
(the pressure gradient is prescribed to be constant value inside the domain) 

Necessary notes on numerical scheme and stability criteria:
1. An diffusion treatment using explicit FTCS (Forward-Time & Central-Difference Scheme) with five-point stencil 
   whereas an convection treatment which is either explicit FTBS (Forward-Time & Backward Scheme) 
   or explicit FTCS.
  
2. a central difference approximation for the
   convection term which is conditionally stable iff the diffusive
   transport is dominant (i.e., we suggest not to selecting the kinematic
   viscosity value too low).

3. issue on numerical stability is mathematically prescribed CFL (Courant-Friedrich-Lewy) condition:
    (ν*dt)/(dx*dx) ≤ 1/2
